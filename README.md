# Distinctiveness and Complexity

Smart Rota stands out from other projects in the course by providing a specialized solution for workforce management. This project does not replicate the functionality of any prior projects such as Search, Wiki, or Mail, ensuring it meets the distinctiveness criterion set by CS50W.

- **Models and Backend**: While the course requires at least one Django model, Smart Rota incorporates five distinct models and one user manager class, each serving a unique aspect of rota management. This architectural structure supports a robust backend necessary to provide complex business solutions.
- **Frontend Technologies**: The frontend utilizes React coupled with Redux for state management. This setup, particularly the use of Redux for managing authentication states, introduces a level of complexity not required in earlier projects.
- **User Interface**: Special attention has been given to the user interface, with smooth animations and custom-built data visualization components. These elements enhance the overall user experience by providing intuitive and visually engaging interactions.

- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Consistent with the requirements, Smart Rota is fully responsive across all devices. The mobile-first design approach ensures accessibility and usability, which is demonstrated in the accompanying screencast.

### Conclusion:

Smart Rota is designed with the goal of not only fulfilling but exceeding the requirements of the CS50W capstone project. It introduces new technologies and complex functionalities that set it apart from simpler web applications, thereby addressing a real-world problem with a scalable and innovative web solution.

# Files

## Backend

**/smart_rota/urls.py:**

This file configures the URL routing for the Smart Rota Django project, defining patterns that route requests to appropriate views. It includes routes for Django's admin interface, JWT authentication (obtain, refresh, verify tokens), and serving the `manifest.json` for web app features, alongside the primary application routes from `main.urls`.

**/main/urls.py:**

This file defines the URL patterns for the 'main' app in the Smart Rota project, routing various endpoints to their corresponding views. It includes paths for user authentication (login, logout), user registration for different roles (employer, employee, company), and rota management functions such as viewing and updating timetables, handling shift change requests, and retrieving team data.

**/main/utils.py:**

This utility file contains a function `check_message_duplicates` which checks for duplicate entries in the `Messages` and `TimeTable` models based on user details and shift times. This function is used to prevent the submission of redundant shift requests, enhancing data integrity within the application.

**/main/views.py:**

This file encapsulates all the view logic for the Smart Rota application, handling both web and API requests. It includes functions for user login, logout, registration, and various APIViews to manage company registration, team data retrieval, shift updates, and handling shift change requests. Each class and function is equipped to interact with the application's models using Django's ORM and handle HTTP requests, providing responses suitable for both web and API clients. The views also implement user authentication checks and data serialization to ensure secure and efficient data handling.

**/main/models.py:**

This file defines the data models for the application, extending Django's built-in user model and introducing custom models tailored to the application's needs.

1. **User**: Customized from `AbstractUser`, this model adds `employer_code` and `user_type` fields to facilitate role-based and company-specific functionalities.
2. **Company**: Represents companies with unique names and codes, enabling distinct access and management within the platform.
3. **MyUser**: An alternative user model that uses email as the primary identifier, managed by `UserAccountManager`, supporting both regular and superuser creation.
4. **TimeTable**: Stores shift schedules for users, including employer association, shift times, and dates, ensuring schedules are maintained per company and user.
5. **Messages**: Handles intra-application messaging and requests, such as shift changes, storing sender and receiver details, message types, and related scheduling information.

These models are crucial for managing users, companies, and operational data like schedules and communications within the application.

**/main/admin.py:**

This file configures the Django admin interface, registering the `User` and `Company` models to make them accessible through the admin panel. This allows for easy management and administration of these entities within the Django admin site.

**/main/apps.py:**

Defines the `MainConfig` class, which configures settings specific to the 'main' application, such as its name and the default field type for automatically generated primary keys.

**/main/serializers.py:**

Contains serializers for the `User`, `Company`, `TimeTable`, and `Messages` models, facilitating the conversion of model instances into JSON format and vice versa for API operations. This includes a `RegisterSerializer` for user registration, enforcing password validation and handling user creation.

**/main/tests.py:**

Provides test cases for various views within the 'main' application using Django's testing framework. This file includes tests for user authentication processes (login and logout), viewing the index page, and other functionalities such as team retrieval, ensuring that each component behaves as expected.
