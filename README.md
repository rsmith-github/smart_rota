This is a non-industry-specific rota-management system built to solve the problem of imperfect time management due to flaws in human memory. Many times managers will have to ask their emoloyees what time their shift started and ended. With Honest Hours, employees are able to request changes after the rotas have been closed, if the rotas are incorrect. For the most part, rotas will be closed correctly anyway. However, for those occasions where the manager just didnt have time to check with the employee, or simply forgot, the emplpyees can request a change. After a request has been made, a manager can then approve the request.
